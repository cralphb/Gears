This repo was created to demonstrate skills learned for the Developing Data Products Class of Coursera's Data Science Specialization.

For this project we've created a Shiny web application and accompanying server logic (ui.R & server.R files) with a user interface that return miles per gallon based on parameters entered.

If viewing these files in RStudio, you can run the application by clicking the 'Run App' button at the top, right. Otherwise you can 
run the app on Shinyaps.io (https://cralphb.shinyapps.io/Gears/)


We've also developed a short presentation with RStudio Presenter that you see in this Repo as "BestMPG.Rpres". For ease of viewing, this presentation has been published as HTML in this Repo's gh-pages. To view, go to the following URL:
